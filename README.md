# python-face-recognition


A repo for my personal python face recognition project. I will be integrating into the larger smart recognition project. 

remember to import all libraries needed with pip

pip install face_recognition 

I am using $python3 filename.py  
to activate the python file


if you are running in Linux you'll need to give permissions with chmod +x filename.py
